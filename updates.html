<h4>I have been working with a lot of spatial data lately, and with the quarentine I haven’t been able to access ArcGIS on my campus windows machine. This has forced me to learn how to work with spatial data in R and QGIS. I have found ways to do almost anything that I could do with ArcGIS, and all for free! <a href="generating_DEM/GeneratingDEMExample.html"><em>Here is a markdown document</em></a> with an example of a couple of the packages that I have found really useful. I use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elevatr/elevatr.pdf"><em>elevatr package</em></a>, which downloads digital elevation models (DEMs) for a region given points or a polygon (like the region to the right), and the <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/"><em>mapview package</em></a>, which is really useful for quickly and interactively viewing spatial data. Additionally, <a href="Resources/SpatialDataResources.html"><em>here is a list of resources</em></a> that I have found particlarly useful in understanding and working with spatial data in R.</h4>

<h4>Check out our <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1axrvB8ccoDOo"><em>new paper</em></a> that was just published in Science of the Total Environnment looking at the infiltration rate controls on denitrification during infiltration. We designed a way to collect intact sediment cores and pump artificial groundwater through them in the lab. Then we measured the changes in nitrate and carbon as water flowed through the soils at different rates. We also looked at the response from the soil microbial populations and it was a surpringly strong signal. Then, we added woodchips to see if that would jump start the denitrification process and it did! Results from this study and others like it are helping to develop technologies to improve groundwater quality through the use of managed aquifer recharge.</h4>

<h4>As of the end of February Santa Cruz has received 4,280 mm of precipitation in water year 2020, that’s just 75% of our average annual value up to that date. In Santa Cruz, January and February are generally our wettest months accounting for almost 40% of the annual rainfall on average. February was really dry (and beautiful), making it feel like it has been a particularly dry year overall, but I think this might just be a function of recency bias. January was a little below average for the area, and December was anomalously wet. In places like California, where extremes in precipitation are the expectation, it can be hard to gauge how far we’ve deviated from the norm without looking at the numbers. Global climate models can’t seem to agree on where we will see increases and decreases in overall precipiation with climate change, but there is concensus that intensity and variability of hydrologic extremes will continue to increase.</h4>

The vineyard is a site selected for one of the first flood managed aquifer recharge (F-MAR) projects in the region. During the rainy season about 1000 acres of the vineyard will be flooded with excess flows from the nearby Consumnes River in an effort to recharge the underlying aquifers. It’s the first project of its scale in the area, and if it’s succsessful, there are likley to be many more like it in the future. Led by Jenny (at the top of the ladder), we helped collect sediment cores that she will analyze and conduct experiments on to investigate changes in fluid geochemistry during infiltration.</h4>

<h4>Gave two talks at the Internationl Symposium for Managed Aquifer Recharge in Madrid. One talk was focused mapping denitrification across landscapes (<a href="files/ISMAR_DenitMapping_Presentation.pdf"><em>slides here</em></a>) and the other talk was on the recharge suitability web application that I developed (<a href="files/ISMAR_AppPresentation.pdf"><em>slides here</em></a>). The conference was very international, and it was exciting to see MAR projects from all over the world. It was also held in an old elevator factory!</h4>
