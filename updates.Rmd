#### Finished TAing ESCI100, Intro to Environmental Systems, a calculus based modeling class looking at budgets and environmental processes. We only had four students, so they each got a lot of attention.

#### Gave two talks at the Internationl Symposium for Managed Aquifer Recharge in Madrid. One talk was focused mapping denitrification across landscapes ([_slides here_](files/ISMAR_DenitMapping_Presentation.pdf)) and the other talk was on the recharge suitability web application that I developed ([_slides here_](files/ISMAR_AppPresentation.pdf)). The conference was very international, and it was exciting to see MAR projects from all over the world. It was also held in an old elevator factory!

#### Attending a workshop in Nicosia, Cyprus with regional collaborators to help develop maps and modeling products for groundwater recharge suitability in the Middle East and North Africa. The workshop was part of a larger collaboration between US-AID, USGS, and the countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and other regional partners. Energizing to talk to folks from other parts of the world interested in similar topics!
