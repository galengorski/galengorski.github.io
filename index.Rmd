#### I am interested in issues related to water quantity and quality 
#### in natural and managed landscapes. 
#### I work with Andrew Fisher and the rest of the UCSC Hydrogeology Team 
#### to understand fundemental connections between 
#### hydrologic and biogeochemical cycling. 
#### I use a combination of field, lab and modeling methods, 
#### and I am particularly interested in developing understanding 
#### at multiple different scales from centimeter to continental.
